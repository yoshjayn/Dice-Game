React Fundamentals    : Understanding components, props, state management using hooks (useState in this case), and JSX syntax.
Component Structure   : Building reusable components for different parts of the UI (StartGame and GamePlay).
Conditional Rendering : Showing/hiding components based on the application state.
Event Handling        : Responding to user interactions like button clicks (potentially in the StartGame component).
Basic Game Logic      : Understanding how to design and implement game mechanics using programming concepts like variables, loops, and conditional statements.

App.jsx: This is the main component of the application.
It imports necessary components (StartGame and GamePlay) and the useState hook from React.
The useState hook is used to manage the game state. In this case, a state variable isStarted is used to track whether the game has been started or not.
The toggleGamePlay function is responsible for changing the isStarted state between true and false. This likely controls the visibility of the start screen and gameplay screen.
The application conditionally renders either the StartGame or GamePlay component based on the isStarted state.

In this project, I built a command-line dice game using JavaScript. This project demonstrates my capabilities in:

Game Design          : I designed the core mechanics of the dice game, including rules, player interaction, and win/lose conditions.
Software Development : I implemented the game logic using programming constructs like variables, loops, conditional statements, and functions.
User Interface       : I created a user-friendly command-line interface for players to interact with the game.
Testing              : I wrote unit tests to ensure the game functions as intended.
